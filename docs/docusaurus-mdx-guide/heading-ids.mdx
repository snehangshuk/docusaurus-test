# Defining Headings
* Headings should use `Title Capitalization Like This`.
* Subheadings, anything less than h1 or markdown level 1: `#`, should use `Sentence capitalization like this`.
* Subheadings which are numbered steps to follow should start with `Step 0:`.
* Subheadings which are numbered steps should have the first word after the colon capitalized like this: `Step 0: Do something great`.
* Headings should not end with a period.
* Leave a blank line above and below headings.
* Add an introduction section as `## Introduction` with a short overview of what the page is about.
Page titles should be self-sufficient. 

Headings are defined using `h1(#) => h6(######)`
```markdown
# Heading 1 (h1 level)
## Heading 2 (h2 level)
### Heading 3 (h3 level)
...
####### Heading 6 (h6 level)
```

:::tip One h1 per doc

There should be one only `h1(#)` per document. But there can be multiple `h2(##)=>h6(######)` in a document.

## Heading IDs

Docusaurus will by default generate an id for each heading to be able to link to individual sections.

The generated id's are nothing but the `kebab-cased-heading-text-itself`.
Example:
```
## Heading H2 example

<!-- will have a generated id as below -->
heading-h2-example
```

### Custom Heading IDs

Docusaurus allows to define custom heading ids are well. Use the following define the custom heading id.

```markdown
My Heading {#introduction}
```

Prefer lowercase kebab-cased heading ids.

### Usage of Heading IDs

You can use the heading ids to create a custom table of content or use this as a link for referance. Here is an example to use as link for referance. Example:

```markdown
[Heading IDs](/docusaurus-mdx-guide/heading-ids#heading-ids)
```
Rendered as:<br/>
[Heading IDs](/docusaurus-mdx-guide/heading-ids#heading-ids)

Please refer to the Docusaurus docs on [Headings](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/headings) for more insights into usage and customization.
