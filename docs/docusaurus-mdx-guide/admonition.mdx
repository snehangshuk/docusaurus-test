# Admonitions

Call-out admonitions allow you to highlight parts of the documentation which require special attention or which
don't fit in the usual flow of content.

```markdown
:::note

**This** is an example of a call-out admonition. For more info please get in touch with us on [Slack](https://slack.gg/vBPpJkS).

:::
```

```markdown
:::note Additional Resources

:::
```

:::caution Please note the empty lines

Please ensure to leave empty lines in the start and the end (first and last lines). This to avoid prettier messing
up the formatting in this Docusaurus special syntax.

Read about it on the [Docusaurus Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions#usage-with-prettier)
