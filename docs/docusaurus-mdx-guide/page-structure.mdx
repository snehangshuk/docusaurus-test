# Docs Page Structure

## Meta information

The following meta information should be added at the beginning of each docs page: `description` and `tags`.

An example:

```markdown
---
description: How to use EngX
tags:
  - engx
  - frontend
  - developer productivity
---
```

## How to organize the docs

Read more about organizing content under `docs` directory at [Organizing folder structure](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc#organizing-folder-structure) in Docusaurus documentation.

Every document has a unique `id`. By default, a document `id` is the name of the document (without the extension) relative to the root `docs` directory.
You can modify the `id` of a document using the `id` when defining the meta information of document.

```markdown
---
id: my-id
---
```

## React component imports

Add any React component imports right below the frontmatter and before starting the main doc content. Before using a component be sure to know the [prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) required to use the component. 

:::danger SAVE THE FILE AS MDX

It is important to savve the file as MDX when using React components.

### Using a React component

Here is a example to use a react component in Docusaurus. The `PeopleCard` component uses the following props: `first`, `last`, `image`, and `notes`
```jsx
import Person from '@site/src/components/PeopleCard';
import DocusaurusImageUrl from '@site/static/img/docusaurus.png'

...
<Person first="Snehangshu" last="Karmakar" image={DocusaurusImageUrl} notes= "Instructional Engineer" />
...
```

:::tip HOW TO REFERANCE A REACT COMPONENT?

When importing components from `src/` directory, please do not use relative paths. Docusaurus provides a global variable `@site` which is resolved to the root of the app - absolute import. So, doing `@site/src/components/PeopleCard` is the same as `../../../src/components/PeopleCard`.

:::

This is how it is rendered.

<Person
  first="Snehangshu"
  last="Karmakar"
  image={DocusaurusImageUrl}
  notes="Instructional Engineer"
/>

## Page title

Add the main title for each docs page.

An example:

```
# Using CRT
```

You can also add `title` frontmatter.

```markdown
---
title: Using CRT
---
```

By default the title will be the label for sidebar item. So, to use a shorten/different label for sidebar use the
`sidebar_label` frontmatter to override.

## Table of contents

This is auto generated on the right sidebar. And the depth can be controlled via `toc_max_heading_level`,
`toc_min_heading_level` frontmatter.

Please refer to the [Table of Contents](/docusaurus-mdx-guide/table-of-contents) section to understand more about how to render this manually in between content and filtering items, etc.

## Markdown Variables

Add the markdown variables at very end of file for easier reference and maintainability. These variables are mostly for
links. To avoid repetition of adding full path for each link, we could take advantage of
[reference-style-links](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link) syntax in markdown.

For Example:

```markdown
## Section one

.....

On how to use admonitions ... [Admonition][admonition-page]

....

## Section two

.....

Learn how to use [markdown variables][variables]

....

<!-- Shared Link Variables -->

[admonition-page]: /docusaurus-mdx-guide/admonition
[variables]: /docusaurus-mdx-guide/page-structure#markdown-variables
```
