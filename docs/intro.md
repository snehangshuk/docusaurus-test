# Get Started with Documentation

## What is good documentation?
Good documentation uses clear, simple, effective communication to explain the usage and workings of our product as completely as possible.

Documentation is critically important. It's our most visited web property besides the homepage and without good, thorough documentation, users can not use, or enjoy using our product.

:::danger THE RULE

If a product feature doesnâ€™t have excellent feature and reference documentation then it is not a finished feature.

:::

Good documentation is vital to the health of our company and brand. Users often discover new features or upgrade based on information they find in documentation.

Every Hasurian is responsible for creating and continually improving the documentation.

Your task is to create rich, correct documentation content which fully covers the feature being referenced in a user-obsessed, complete and compelling way.

## Types of documentation
We strive to create quality, rich content in four logical areas of documentation including:

* Explanation
* Task guides
* Tutorials
* Reference

It is your task to consider which of these types of documentation fits the user requirement most for the feature you are documenting it. Maybe it's two or three, maybe it's all of them
