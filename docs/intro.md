# Get Started with Documentation

## What is good documentation?
Good documentation uses clear, simple, effective communication to explain the usage and workings of a product as completely as possible.

Documentation is critically important. It's our most visited web property and engineers looks forward to solve a problem without good, thorough documentation, engineers can not use, or increase thier productivity.

:::danger THE RULE

If a tool/product feature doesnâ€™t have excellent feature and reference documentation then it is not a finished feature.

:::

Good documentation is vital to the health of a company's engineering team. Engineers often discover new features and automate things based on information they find in documentation.

Every engineer is responsible for creating and continually improving the documentation.

Your task is to create rich, correct documentation content which fully covers the feature being referenced in a user-obsessed, complete and compelling way.

## Types of documentation
To create quality, rich content in four logical areas of documentation including:

* Explanation
* Task guides
* Tutorials
* Reference

Engineers must have a task to consider which of these types of documentation fits the user requirement most for the feature they are documenting it. Maybe it's two or three, maybe it's all of them.
